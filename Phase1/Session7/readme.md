Session 7

This assignment covers the topics of scopes and closures.

We are solving the below 4 problems in this assignment

# 1
Write a closure that takes a function and then check whether the function passed has a docstring with more than 50 characters. 50 is stored as a free variable

# 2
Write a closure that gives you the next Fibonacci number

# 3
Write a closure that can keep a track of how many times add/mul/div functions were called, and update a global dictionary variable with the counts

# 4
Modify above such that now we can pass in different dictionary variables to update different dictionaries
